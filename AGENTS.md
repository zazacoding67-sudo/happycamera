## Goal
- Build a Moment-inspired e-commerce site for Happy Camera with admin dashboard, live search, mega menu, image uploads, Toyyibpay checkout, reviews, wishlist, filters, gallery, WhatsApp integration, condition grading, order tracking, email notifications, redesigned admin UI, unified member/admin login flow, polished carousel interactions, premium product detail image display, and a series of visual overhauls to match empi.re / minimalist reference screenshots.

## Constraints & Preferences
- Stack: Next.js 16 (Turbopack, App Router), TypeScript 6, Tailwind CSS v3.4.19, Prisma 7.8.0 (PrismaPg adapter, no `datasource.url`), Supabase PostgreSQL/Storage, NextAuth v4, Toyyibpay, lucide-react, framer-motion, clsx + tailwind-merge, bcryptjs, resend, react-easy-crop v6.
- Design: started with stark white/surface cards, bold typography, crisp edges. Then iterated through: warm `#F2F2F0` page bg (empi.re) → white bg (minimalist revert). Cards went from `border-[#EBEBEB]` + shadow → `bg-[#F5F5F5]` no border → white with subtle shadow → white with no shadow / `rounded-2xl` image area.
- Current state: Navbar is a simple 3-column grid — left `text-[13px] font-medium` links (Home, Shop, News, Contact), center `text-xl font-bold` logo, right SearchModal + cart icon. Mega menu removed. ProductCard `aspect-square bg-[#f4f4f4] rounded-2xl p-6 flex`, image `max-w-full max-h-full object-contain` via `<img>`, badges `bg-black text-white text-[10px] font-bold uppercase tracking-widest px-3 py-1.5 rounded-full top-3 left-3 flex-row`. Title `text-[14px] text-black font-medium mt-3`. FilterSidebar accordion with `+`/`−`, section headers `13px font-semibold`, checkboxes `w-4 h-4 border-gray-300 rounded-sm focus:ring-black`, labels `text-[13px] text-[#333] ml-3`. Category pills restored in `/shop` as `border border-gray-300 rounded-full px-4 py-1.5 text-[13px]`. Page bg white.
- Touch: complete isolation from synthesized mouse events using `pointer: coarse` detection + `lastTouchTime` timestamp guard.
- No customer account system currently exists (affects wishlist — uses localStorage, not server).
- `.env` + `.env.local` both used (Prisma CLI reads `.env.local` via `prisma.config.ts`, Next.js reads `.env.local`).
- `prefers-reduced-motion` supported via `useReducedMotion` hook with fallback path in `PageTransition`.
- All admin pages use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` except `/admin/login` and `/admin/signout` (static).
- Currency: RM (Malaysian Ringgit), formatted as `RM 4,299` via `formatPrice()`.
- All prices shown as RM, not `$`.
- Crop modal aspect ratio: 4:3 (landscape) matching product card grid.
- Product names in DB no longer contain `(Preloved)` or `(New)` suffixes — condition shown separately via badge.
- Condition values in DB are lowercase `"preloved"` and `"new"` — matching filter strings.

## Progress
### Done
- **Schema (all phases)**: added `ConditionGrade` enum (MINT, EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR), `OrderStatus` enum (PENDING, PAID, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED), `Review` model, `Product.images` (String[]), `Product.stockQuantity` (Int, default 1), `Product.conditionGrade`, `Product.conditionNotes`, `Product.includedAccessories` (String[]), `Product.shutterCount` (Int?), `Product.mount` (String?), `Product.format` (String?), `Order.courierName`, `Order.trackingNumber`. Removed `Product.inStock` and `Product.imageUrl`. `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` applied.
- **Login flow**: Redesigned `/admin/login` as split-screen. Created `/admin/signout` confirmation card. Created unified `/login` page with role-based redirect (admin → `/admin`, others → `/`). Updated NextAuth `pages.signIn` to `/login` in both `route.ts` and `middleware.ts`.
- **Phase 1 — Trust & Credibility**: `ConditionReport.tsx` (grade badge with colour hierarchy, mount/format/shutter display, pill shape). `lib/policies.ts`. `ReviewSection.tsx` with submission form + moderation. `POST /api/reviews` + `PATCH /api/reviews/[id]`. `/admin/reviews` table. `WhatsAppButton.tsx` (floating, desktop hover tooltip). `Footer.tsx`.
- **Phase 2 — Product & Shopping Experience**: `Gallery.tsx` (defensive `validImages` filter, hides strip when ≤1, fixed `h-[480px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `object-contain`, no hover/transitions, `p-6` breathing room, thumbnails `64×64` with `opacity-60` inactive state). `MultiImageUpload.tsx` (react-easy-crop v6, crop area background `#1A1A1A`, 4:3 crop, canvas export, clamped coordinates, replaces images array). `AddToCartButton` state machine. Stock scarcity display. Related products. `WishlistContext.tsx` (localStorage). `/wishlist` page. `FilterSidebar.tsx`. `/shop` reads `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `brand`, `condition`, `category` params. Checkout decrements `stockQuantity`.
- **Product form redesign**: `components/admin/ProductForm.tsx` — card-based two-column layout (6 cards), per-field validation, auto-slug, breadcrumbs, delete with confirmation.
- **All Phases — Migration from `imageUrl` to `images`**: Schema column dropped. All queries use `images` field.
- **Phase 3 — Orders + Tracking + Emails**: `/admin/orders` list. `/admin/orders/[id]` detail with status toggle + courier tracking. `PATCH /api/orders/[id]`. `lib/email.ts` (Resend).
- **Phase 4 — Content & SEO**: `/story`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/returns` pages. `generateMetadata` on `/product/[slug]` + JSON-LD. `generateMetadata` on `/shop`, `/shop/new`, `/shop/preloved`.
- **Phase 6 — Polish**: SVG favicon. Sticky mobile add-to-cart bar. Legal pages. Footer.
- **Admin overhaul (dashboard + sidebar)**: Route group `(dashboard)`. Dark sidebar with nav, sign-out, active state. Dashboard metric cards + recent orders + low-stock alerts. Products list with search, edit/delete, stock badges. Orders list with search + pill status. Reviews moderation with star ratings + approve/reject.
- **Mount/Format spec fix**: Mount/format added to schema, `db push`. Both in `ProductForm`. Product detail page renders conditionally. HINISO mount/format cleared to null. API routes pass mount/format through.
- **Category fix**: 3 missing categories added to seed + live DB. Homepage cards use all 6. Dropdown auto-reads via `prisma.category.findMany()`.
- **Price format**: Created `lib/format.ts` with `formatPrice()`. Replaced ALL inline `$` strings across: `ProductCard.tsx`, `CartDrawer.tsx`, `StickyAddToCart.tsx`, `AddToCartButton.tsx`, `SearchModal.tsx`, product detail page, all admin pages (ProductsClient, OrdersClient, order detail, dashboard metric), JSON-LD changed to "MYR".
- **Seed — 20 products**: Refactored seed from `deleteMany`+`createMany` to `upsert` pattern (re-runnable). 7 categories. Latest seed run: 20 products with entirely re-matched Unsplash images. Products removed: Peak Design Everyday Backpack 20L, Wonderchef Dry Cabinet 30L, Forspark Dry Box 10L, duplicate X100VI. Products added: HINISO Electronic Dry Cabinet 60L, Peli 1510 Case, Digi Cabi DHC-N150. Product names stripped of `(Preloved)`/`(New)` suffixes. Condition values use lowercase `"preloved"`/`"new"`. Ran `npx prisma db seed`.
- **CategoryCarousel visual overhaul**: Segmented index ticks, ghost arrows, drag hint, depth-of-field card scaling, edge fade mask, condition badges, `formatPrice()`.
- **Product page premium UI/UX upgrade**: Brand `tracking-[0.2em]`, title `leading-tight`, price `text-2xl`, red low-stock pill, trust signals under `border-t` divider, spec table converted to `<dl>` with `divide-y`, primary CTA button `h-14 text-[15px] uppercase font-semibold`, ghost trade-in button, reviews section editorial heading + sharp input focus.
- **Gallery multi-upload fix**: Added `uploadedInBatchRef` to accumulate URLs during batch crop processing (fixes stale closure).
- **Seed image audit**: All 20 product images replaced with correctly matched Unsplash photo IDs. Verified in DB.
- **Cleanup Round 2**: (1) `quality={85}` on all thumbnails, (2) stripped `(Preloved)`/`(New)` from seed names, (3) `text-[var(--color-text-primary)]` on parent `<dl>` for spec table, (4) proper singular/plural `unit`/`units`, (5) `object-contain` + `flex items-center justify-center` for white gap fix.
- **Gallery final rewrite**: Fixed `h-[480px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, removed `boxShadow`, removed `hover:scale`, removed all transition classes, added `p-6` on image, thumbnails `64×64` with `opacity-60` inactive state.
- **THIS SESSION — Layout alignment pass**:
  - **Navbar**: Completely rewritten from mega menu system to strict 3-column grid (`grid grid-cols-3 items-center`). Left `justify-start`: text links (Home, Shop, News, Contact) at `text-[13px] font-medium`. Center `justify-center`: "Happy Camera" logo at `text-xl font-bold`. Right `justify-end`: SearchModal (search input + results) and cart icon.
  - **ProductCard**: Image container changed to `relative aspect-square w-full bg-[#f4f4f4] rounded-2xl p-6 flex items-center justify-center`. Image changed from Next.js `Image fill` to `<img>` tag with `max-w-full max-h-full object-contain` (respects padding, no stretching). Title changed to `text-[14px] text-black font-medium mt-3`.
  - **Shop page**: Category pills restored as `border border-gray-300 rounded-full px-4 py-1.5 text-[13px] text-gray-600` horizontal row. Product count moved to right side grouped with SortSelect (`justify-end`). Layout gap-fixes.
- **THIS SESSION — Preloved Edit redesigned**: Hero replaced from video to static `home-1.jpg`. Brand New/Preloved toggle + swap-carousel removed. Non-interactive trust strip (always preloved). NEW `GradingScale` component — 4-panel MINT/EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR explainer with `whileInView` staggered reveal, grade-colored labels/bars. NEW `PinnedScrollSequence` — sticky scroll-driven crossfade through 3 story beats (Character & History → Verified Condition → Built to Last), opacity-only via `useScroll`/`useTransform`, native CSS `sticky`, progress indicator via `scaleY`, reduced-motion fallback (static stacked `whileInView`), mobile disables pinning below `md`. Product gallery replaced from horizontal carousel to CSS columns masonry grid with `conditionNotes` on hover. MarqueeStrip removed from Preloved Edit page (stays on homepage). Server page fetches preloved products only.
- **THIS SESSION — Customer-facing order numbers (committed `967002a`, deployed)**: `Order.orderNumber` (`String? @unique`, format `HC-` + 8 uppercase alphanumerics, alphabet excludes I/O/0/1). **Adopted Prisma migrations for the first time**: baselined the db-push DB as `0_init` (marked applied via `prisma migrate resolve`, never re-run) + `20260808000000_add_order_number` applied via `prisma migrate deploy`. `lib/orderNumber.ts` (generator) + `lib/orderFactory.ts` `createOrderWithOrderNumber()` (P2002 retry loop, max 5) used by `/api/checkout` AND `/api/orders/manual` (manual orders need one too). Backfilled all 53 existing orders via `scripts/backfill-order-numbers.ts --apply` (dry-run by default). Surfaced: success page full number, `/account` + `/api/orders/customer`, confirmation email (replaces CHIP `paymentReference`), admin OrdersClient + `[id]` page (orderNumber alongside internal ID). `/api/track` + `/track` now look up by orderNumber (case-insensitive, trimmed, generic 404). Playwright test 6 updated to cover success page + `/track` by orderNumber. Full suite 14/14 green, `tsc` clean. Verified live on Vercel prod by real order.
- **THIS SESSION — Auto-apply migrations on Vercel**: Added `"vercel-build": "prisma migrate deploy && next build"` to `package.json` (Vercel auto-runs `vercel-build` over `build` when present; `postinstall` already runs `prisma generate`). First deploy after this succeeded but `migrate deploy` was a **no-op** (migration already applied manually) — the NEXT schema change is the real test of auto-migration. Caveat: a custom Build Command in Vercel dashboard overrides the script; build log should show `npm run vercel-build` + `prisma migrate deploy && next build`.
- **THIS SESSION — Generated-artifact hygiene**: `next-env.d.ts`, `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, `test-results/.last-run.json` were accidentally tracked; untracked (`git rm --cached`) and added to `.gitignore` (also `playwright-report/`).
- **THIS SESSION — Phase 7 e2e verification complete (all four areas)**:
  - **Area 1 — CHIP sandbox round-trip (REAL sandbox UI)**: Success leg PASS (`HC-7FFTWUQJ` PAID via webhook, stock decrement Sony lens 4→3, success page shows full order number, `/admin/orders` confirms). Failure leg PASS (`HC-MHDLG2PL` stayed PENDING, Nikon D610 stock unchanged 1→1). Confirmation email NOT VERIFIABLE locally — `RESEND_API_KEY` absent → `lib/email.ts` silently no-ops (real prod webhook presumably has it in Vercel env). FLAG: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` points to a dead Cloudflare tunnel → CHIP success/cancel redirects hit chrome-error (webhook base is separate and worked).
  - **Area 2 — ProductForm**: all empty-submit inline errors render; `price=0` inline error shows; `price=-5`/`stock=-1` blocked by native `min="0"` (input keeps value, server 400s too) — no inline JS error for those (acceptable, noted); preloved-without-grade inline error shows; `normalizeBrand()` confirmed on save via POST + PATCH (`pgytech`→`PGYTECH`, `f-stop`→`F-Stop`); throwaway product created then deleted.
  - **Area 3 — Crop/upload**: T1 unsupported type, T2 >5MB, T3 valid-file-opens-modal + low-res warning, T4 single confirm uploads+appends, T5 batch appends (1→2→3) all PASS. Initial "0 thumbnails after first upload" anomaly NOT reproducible across 20 consecutive runs (10 instrumented); every run showed deterministic success path (upload 200 + storage object + thumbnail). Root-cause hypothesis: confirm click before `onCropComplete` set `croppedAreaPct` (early-return leaves image un-uploaded; batch then proceeds) — dev-mode timing flake, not a code bug. Storage finding: bucket `camera-images` has ONLY an INSERT RLS policy ("Allow Public Uploads") — anon can upload but not SELECT/DELETE; public-URL GET works (public bucket), so the app is unaffected; the anon SDK `list()` returning empty is expected.
  - **Area 4 — Login**: `e2e/auth.spec.ts` 4/4 green — admin creds → dashboard; customer creds blocked from `/admin` (role gate via proxy.ts); failed login → single generic message, no account-existence leak; customer Google sign-in UI with generic OAuth error handling.
  - **Cleanup (approved)**: deleted 63 orphaned 762-byte 1×1 test JPEGs from `camera-images` bucket (temp SELECT+DELETE RLS policy added then dropped; removed via Storage API so S3 files + rows both cleaned); deleted stray PENDING probe orders `HC-NBX9JK9E` + `HC-PTZFERKW` (items first — `OrderItem.order` FK is Restrict). Kept evidence: `HC-7FFTWUQJ` (PAID) + `HC-MHDLG2PL` (PENDING). All scratch scripts (chip-probe/success/failure, area2/area3 diags, list-*, verify-admin-orders, check-resend, cleanup-e2e) deleted; real user orders (ilhamammar55@gmail.com) untouched.

### In Progress
- (none)

### Blocked
- (none)

## Key Decisions
- `Product.inStock` dropped; `stockQuantity > 0` is single source of truth. `imageUrl` column also dropped — only `images[]` exists.
- `Order.status` changed from free string to `OrderStatus` enum — existing data lost during `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` (acceptable, no production orders yet).
- `ProductCard.tsx` marked `"use client"` to support `WishlistContext` heart toggle — all consumers receive props unchanged.
- Wishlist uses client-only localStorage since there are no customer accounts; flagged for future server-side migration.
- Filters on `/shop` use URL search params for shareable/bookmarkable URLs.
- Gallery changed from `aspect-[4/3]` to fixed `h-[480px]` — all products show at same height regardless of image ratio.
- Gallery background `bg-[#f5f5f5]` (neutral light) — works for both white-bg and dark-bg product photos without visible black bars.
- Gallery main image uses `object-contain` with `p-6` padding — full camera visible, never cropped, intentional breathing room.
- Thumbnails use `opacity-60` for inactive state instead of border-only change.
- **THIS SESSION (Layout)**: Mega menu replaced with simple text links. User explicitly requested this layout: `grid grid-cols-3 items-center` with text links, centered logo, search bar + cart.
- **THIS SESSION (Preloved Edit)**: Preloved page reframed as storytelling — Grading Scale explains the enum, Pinned Scroll Sequence makes an emotional case through 3 scrollytelling beats, editorial masonry gallery reveals per-item condition on hover. MarqueeStrip replaced by PinnedScrollSequence (MarqueeStrip stays on homepage only).
- **Pinned Scroll Sequence**: opacity-only crossfade via `useScroll`/`useTransform`; native CSS `sticky` for pinning; legibility overlays (`bg-gradient-to-r from-black/80 via-black/40 to-transparent` on static `div`, never on animated element); full static-stack fallback under reduced motion or mobile <768px. 4 segment panels with ~5% overlap crossfade, progress indicator via `scaleY`.
- MultiImageUpload `onChange` appends via ref `uploadedInBatchRef.current = [...uploadedInBatchRef.current, urlData.publicUrl]` — fixes stale closure bug during batch processing.
- All prices formatted via centralised `formatPrice()` in `lib/format.ts` — no inline `$` strings remain.
- Login pages (public `/login` and `/admin/login`) share the same split-screen layout but differ in headline/subheading.
- **Order numbers**: `Order.orderNumber` kept nullable + unique so existing rows backfill cleanly. Generated at creation time (never lazy) in both checkout and manual-order paths via `createOrderWithOrderNumber()`. `/api/track` matches by orderNumber, `mode: "insensitive"`, trimmed, generic 404 (no existence leak). Generated artifacts (`next-env.d.ts`, `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`) are gitignored and untracked.

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 5 — Admin / Operations**: Replace dashboard overview with recharts revenue chart + top products. Build CSV bulk product upload page (`/admin/products/upload`).
2. **Auto-migration real test**: The NEXT schema change must go through the normal flow (`prisma migrate dev` to create the migration, commit it) — Vercel's `vercel-build` (`prisma migrate deploy && next build`) should auto-apply it during deploy. That deploy is the first genuine test of auto-migration (the `add_order_number` deploy was a no-op since it was already applied manually). Confirm the build log shows `npm run vercel-build` and no migrate error. Do NOT `db push` or manually apply schema changes anymore — always a committed migration.
3. **Env fix before next live test**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` points to a dead Cloudflare tunnel (`smoke-handmade-continues-offshore.trycloudflare.com` → curl 000). CHIP `success_redirect`/`cancel_redirect` are built from it, so sandbox round-trips redirect to chrome-error. Set it to the real Vercel prod URL (or a live tunnel) for any future payment round-trip test. Consider adding `RESEND_API_KEY` to `.env.local` if confirmation-emails need local verification.

## Critical Context
- `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` was used multiple times. No production data exists so this is acceptable.
- Admin login: `admin@happycamera.com` / `wilson123` at `/admin/login` or `/login`.
- WhatsApp number env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`.
- Image crop: `react-easy-crop` v6, CSS imported as `"react-easy-crop/react-easy-crop.css"`, canvas-to-blob JPEG quality 0.85, max 2400px longest side. Crop aspect 4:3. Default zoom=1 (fill frame). Background `#1A1A1A`.
- Upload appends to images array via ref: `uploadedInBatchRef.current = [...uploadedInBatchRef.current, urlData.publicUrl]` — old URLs are preserved during batch.
- Storage bucket `camera-images` is public with only an INSERT RLS policy ("Allow Public Uploads"). Anon clients can upload and GET public URLs but canNOT `list()`/`remove()` (no SELECT/DELETE policy). Cleanups must use a temporary SELECT+DELETE policy (added via `storage.objects` SQL, then dropped) or the service_role key.
- Products in DB: 20 total (7 cameras, 6 bags, 5 dry boxes + Zeiss lens in Lenses category). Product names no longer have `(Preloved)`/`(New)` suffixes.
- 7 categories in DB: Film Cameras, Digital Bodies, Lenses, Accessories, Dry Box, Bag, Camera.
- Public `/login` redirects admin users to `/admin` on success, others to `/`. NextAuth `pages.signIn` set to `/login`.
- Condition values in DB are lowercase `"preloved"` and `"new"` — matching filter strings.
- **Navbar**: Replaced mega menu with simple 3-column grid layout (`grid grid-cols-3 items-center`). Left: Home, Shop, News, Contact text links. Center: logo. Right: search bar + cart.
- **CartDrawer.tsx** has `"use client"` and uses `useCart()` from `CartContext` — includes checkout button.
- **Pinned Scroll Sequence**: opacity-only crossfade via `useScroll`/`useTransform`; native CSS `sticky` for pinning; legibility overlays (`bg-gradient-to-r from-black/80 via-black/40 to-transparent` on static `div`, never on animated element); full static-stack fallback under reduced motion or mobile <768px. 3 beat panels with ~5% overlap crossfade, progress indicator via `scaleY`.
- **Migrations**: `prisma/migrations/` exists now (`0_init` baseline + `20260808000000_add_order_number`). All 53 orders have `orderNumber` backfilled. Schema changes go through committed migrations (`prisma migrate dev` locally), applied automatically on Vercel via `vercel-build`. Never `db push` on the live DB.
- **Vercel build**: `package.json` `vercel-build = prisma migrate deploy && next build`; `postinstall = prisma generate`. A custom Build Command in the Vercel dashboard would override `vercel-build` — if auto-migration stops working, check that setting first.
