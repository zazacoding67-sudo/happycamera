        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[#1A1A1A] font-semibold mt-6">1. General</h2>
        <p>
          These terms apply to all visitors and users of Happy Camera. We
          reserve the right to change, modify, or remove any part of these
          Terms at any time without prior notice. Violation of these terms
          may result in suspension or termination of your access to our
          website or services.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, all materials on this website — including
          images, designs, icons, photographs, and written content — belong
          to Happy Camera and are protected by copyright and trademark laws.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Any comments, suggestions, or feedback you submit to us may be used
          by Happy Camera. You&rsquo;re responsible for ensuring your
          submissions don&rsquo;t infringe on any third party&rsquo;s rights,

          4. Product Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          While we strive for accuracy, product images and colors may vary
          slightly from the actual item due to differences in photography,
          lighting, and display settings — this is especially true for
          preloved gear, where each unit is individually inspected and
          graded. We cannot guarantee your screen will represent every
          product perfectly.
